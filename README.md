2. **What trends exist in movie releases?**
3. **How do average ratings vary by genre?**
4. **Is there a correlation between movie duration and rating?**
5. **Who are the most prolific actors, and how do their movies perform?**

### Dataset

## Part 2: Movie Recommendation System

### Overview
A content-based movie recommendation system that analyzes movie features including genres, themes, actors, and descriptions to provide personalized recommendations.

### Key Features
- Content-based filtering using multiple movie attributes
- TF-IDF vectorization for text processing
- Personalized user profiles based on ratings
- Fast recommendation generation

### Technical Implementation

#### Core Components
1. **Feature Processing**
   - Movies metadata (genres, themes, actors)
   - Text content (descriptions, taglines)
   - User ratings integration

2. **Adding your own Recommendations**
    - Add your own movies + ratings to generate personalized recommendations

```python
# Example usage
user_ratings = pd.DataFrame({
    'name': ['Dune: Part Two', 'Oppenheimer', 'Interstellar'],
    'rating': [5, 5, 5]
})
```

### Performance
- Average response time: 30 seconds
- Recommendations based on content similarity

### Setup and Usage

1. **Installation**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie_recommendation_system.git
cd movie_recommendation_system
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- scipy

3. **Run System**
```bash
python recommendation_system.py
```

### Future Improvements
- Use my dowloaded Letterboxd data to recommend movies for my profile
- Include more movie metadata, such as directors, writers, and studios
